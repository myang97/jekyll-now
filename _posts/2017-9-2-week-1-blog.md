#### What are my expectations of the class?

Glenn Downing's Software Enginnering is a course that will allow students to experience the lifecycle of software development: designing, implementing and testing. I will hopefully learn this lifecycle and become familiar with everyday technologies that developers use in order to create better, more robust code.

#### What did I do this past week?

This past week was a week where I was able to experience the calm before the storm. After coming back to Austin I visited friends and played a ton of board games. I spent over 20 hours in the past couple of days playing Blood Rage, King of Tokyo, and Codenames.

#### What's in my way?

Technically, nothing currently is in my way to start prepping for the incoming interviews this fall as well as getting a jump start on the assignments and readings I should be working on. I must mentally prepare and will myself to start on these activities.

#### What will I do next week?

I plan on starting up my exercise routine regularly again this week (I had a burst appendix a couple months ago which knocked me out of my old routine) and ordering all of the books that I would need for this semester's classes. I also plan on finalizing the courses I'm taking within the next couple of days. I also look forward to the organization meetings for Chinese Student Association and Texas Table Top.

#### What's my experience of the class?

I enjoy the one on one experience Downing forces upon the students, which keeps everyone on their feet and engaged during the class session. I also like the idea of having a daily quiz because we are then pushed to be on top of the lecture material from two days ago.

#### Pick of the week

Over the summer, I worked with a team that utilized JIRA as their product tracking software. JIRA allows teams to identify, track, resolve and test all types of issues a product is facing. The software also contains release versions of said product as well as contains sprints and workflows for individual members and the team. I personally enjoyed and recommend this product for any teams working on a product.
