###### What did you like the least about the class?
There were three critical qualms I had with the class:
1. Class material taught on the class day before the test made up over 30% of the final exam grade.
2. An overview of one of the projects was given three days before the project was due.
3. You cannot use cout during the HackerRank exams, making it almost impossible to debug the code.
I hope none of these events occur again in future OOP classes.

###### What did you like the most about the class?
I enjoyed the projects. Each project tackled a different concept in C++ and allowed us to pair program with another student in the class. I also liked the cold calling in class. This makes the students more alert and more inclined to follow through the entire lecture and understand what is going on.

###### What's the most significant thing you learned?
Coming into OOP, I was very rusty on pointers and references. I was unsure when exactly a parameter or variable needed an asterisk or an ampersand, but now I am confident in my abilities to properly define these symbols. 

###### How many hours a week did you spend coding/debugging/testing for this class?
I spent around 10-15 hours coding/debugging/testing on each project, which spans over 2-3 weeks.

###### How many hours a week did you spend reading/studying for this class?
I spent around 10 hours reading/studying for each of the exams. 

###### How many lines of code do you think you wrote?
I think I wrote around 1,000 lines of code.

###### What required tool did you not know and now find very useful?
Makefile is a tool that I did not utilize before that I now find very useful. Makefiles allow a user to properly define a set of tasks to be executed. This allows for easy compilation and execution of code and tests. Without a makefile, I would have spent a lot more time running commands and waiting for them to complete before running the next command.

###### What's the most useful tool that your group used that was not required?
I currently use iTerm2, which is essentially the mac/linux Terminal that has a key binding feature to open up a minimized window. This feature allows me to quickly open up and minimize Terminal without having to click any buttons. The UI is also very customizable, allowing you to change the opacity of the background and the color scheme.

###### If you could change one thing about the course, what would it be?
The main issue I would want tackled is the amount of time allocated for tests. For some reason, the output feature in HackerRank is disabled during exams, preventing students from even visually seeing where their code messes up. Also, during the second exam, over 50% of the students were not finished up until the last minute. More time should be given to the students for the exams.
